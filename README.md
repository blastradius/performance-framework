#Montana's Site Performance Guideline

The goal of this project was to create a custom Sass style guide for projects that focus on component design. Since then I've positioned the project towards site performance as a guide for my own projects in delivering a site with specific methodology that addresses that process.

The foundation of this project started while exploring Google's Web Starter Kit and Guil Hernandez's Sass tutorials for advanced techniques.
