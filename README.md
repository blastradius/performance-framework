#Montana's Sass Style Guide

The goal of this project is to create a custom style guide for personal projects that can focus on component design. I investigate animation, color, context, layout, responsive presentation and variety of other features that help convey a completed representation of the design fragments used for a site, application or software.

The foundation of this project started while exploring Google's Web Starter Kit and Guil Hernandez's Sass tutorials for advanced techniques.

I've positioned the project towards site performance as a guide for my own projects in delivering a site with specific methodology that addresses that process. I created a basic Sass framework at first, decided to convert the guide into site performance setup.
